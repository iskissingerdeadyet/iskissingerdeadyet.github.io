<h2>About Henry Kissinger</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger">Henry Alfred Kissinger</a>, an American politician, diplomat, and consultant, was born in 1923 and fled Nazi Germany with his family in 1938. Richard Nixon appointed him as National Security Advisor in 1969 and then as Secretary of State in 1973.</p>

<p>He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973, the same year that he supported US involvement in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">Chilean military coup</a>, in which 3,000 Chileans died and 28,000 were arrested and tortured. He is partially or wholly responsible for other violent US policies:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor">Operation Condor</a>, a covert campaign of political repression and state terror implemented by six right-wing dictatorships in South America (1968-1989). The US provided Condor with "military intelligence and training, financial assistance, advanced computers, sophisticated tracking technology, and access to ... telecommunications," knowing that Condor was kidnapping, torturing, and assassinating perceived enemies of the dictators' regimes.</li>
		<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Freedom_Deal">Operation Freedom Deal</a>, a US bombing campaign in eastern Cambodia (1970-1973). The bombings killed between 50,000-150,000 Cambodians.</li> 
		<li>Support for Pakistan as it perpetrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_genocide">genocide against the people of Bangladesh</a> (1971). Kissinger and Nixon fired a US official in Pakistan who sounded the alarm about the genocide, and the US continued supplying weapons to the Pakistani government.</li>
		<li>Passive support of the Argentine military junta through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_War">eight years of state terrorism</a> (1976-1983). Kissinger gave the junta a "green light" for their Dirty War, then stonewalled and ignored American diplomats and politicians who objected to the state-sanctioned disappearance and murder of tens of thousands of innocent civilians.</li>
	</ul>
	
<p>His influence on US foreign policy, which continues to this day, has spurred the US to untold violence around the world.</p>
